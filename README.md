Repository used to store project developed during the **"Welcome to the Django"** class, from May 18th to June 08th 2014. The idea of this project is to have hands-on experience, from development to deployment, using **Django Framework version 1.6** and **TDD methodology**. I'll keep the commentaries for code in English but the displayed content (HTML) will be in Brazilian Portuguese.
